<h5>My experience at AkiraChix</h5>
    <p>My first day at AkiraChix, I felt something i could not even put into words, seeing new faces, new surroundings made me feel like I'm in a different place. Because it was my first time to see the peolple whom I will be with for the rest of the stay at AkiraChix campass, it made me feel nervous for an uknown reason because all of as needed to adjust well so that we can survive and know eacg other well. The all of AkiraChix community were so welcoming for the that first day.</p> 
    <p>I got to learn new topics such as Front web Development, UI/UX design were very hard to study fot the first time since i didn't have the background in those topics but topics like Proffessional Development, Tooling, Navigating Your Journey were very interactive i learnt new things. Fast fowardvto the present. As expected , my life really turned into a routine, it became interesting as how other live theirs. MY today will never be my yesterday because each day i get to learn and know new things.</p>
